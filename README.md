## 🚀 Features

### 🔊 Volume Control
Control the audio output of any media playing in your browser. The extension dynamically adjusts the volume in real-time and displays the volume level as a percentage. Whether you’re listening to music softly in the background or blasting tunes, you have full control.

### ⏯️ Play/Pause Toggle
This feature automatically updates based on whether media is currently playing or paused, and adjusts with a single click. The button will change dynamically to show either a play (▶️) or pause (⏸️) icon depending on the media’s state.

### 🔄 Loop
When you want to hear that favorite song or watch a crucial part of a video on repeat, you can enable the loop feature with just one click.

### ⏩ Playback Speed
Choose from multiple playback speeds:
- Slow down (0.5x) for tutorials or technical content.
- Speed up (2x, 4x, or 8x) for quick skimming or fast-paced consumption.

### 🌗 Dark/Light Mode Toggle
For users who prefer browsing in dark mode, we’ve added a theme toggle that allows you to switch between light and dark modes. The theme persists across sessions, giving you a seamless, personalized experience.
